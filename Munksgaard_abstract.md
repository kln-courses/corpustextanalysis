“Arguing that some topics found by an unsupervised topic model are representative of what Fairclough considers discourses this study measures the prevalence of libertarian discourse on cryptomarkets for illicit substances. While the steps preceding the estimation of the topic model may seem straightforward, in practice this is far from the case. When reducing documents to bags-of-words a great deal of complexity is lost, which is worth consideration when operating within a theoretical understanding of what is of interest in a document. Procedures such as stopword removal, stemming and removal of documents from corpora transform the texts and subsequently the produced topics reflect this. The presentation will go through the collection, extraction and preprocessing which preceded the estimation of the topic model and discuss the implications, both practical and theoretical, of each of these.“
